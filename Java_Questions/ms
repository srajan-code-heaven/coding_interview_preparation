implement stacks using queues

reverse a stack without "new" key word in java

Login to the problem : Count the occurrences of numbers in an array

Sort upto first k elements in ascending order and remaining in descending order remember to handle the corner cases of k>length of array as in this case sort by ascending order entire array.

Code 2: Two string were given find common character of two string and print all possible permutations of particular length.

(Including 2 coding questions https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/rearrange-positive-and-negative-numbers/ and Check if left half of String has same characters as the right half)

1. You have 2 arrays one representing arrival time of n trains and other departure time of n trains (Not corresponding trains) . Tell the minimum number of stations required for no clashes.

2. A file given having a paragraph find the most occurring word and in it first non repeating characters.

 Many travel tickets available Mumbai->delhi, Goa->chennai, Delhi->Bangalore etc. We have to print series of cities in which we can travel using these tickets. Basically Topological sorting question.

 4. Reverse a line word wise eg: Hi my name is xyz -> iH ym eman si zyx
Then he asked me if I had any question for him.

2. Matrix Problem
Given a square matrix A[][] of size N*N.Each element A[i][j] of matrix is red color or blue color.
Red ->1
Blue ->0
You are also given a number k.Find the side of largest square submatix having atmost k
red cells.


1.Difference between abstract and interface?
2.“Animal” should be abstract class or interface?
3.Why java developers thought to introduce interface?
4.Few deep thinking questions on same abstract vs interface topic.
5.Polymorphic Reference in Java.

2.Using stack and queue together,check if string is palindrome or not.


Given an array and a sum,find if there is any pair in array having sum equal to givensum.


There is a square matrix ‘X’ of dimension n x n. It consists of zeros and ones. Given a value k, print the dimensions of a sub matrix of X consisting at most k zeros.

we cant modify unmodifiableList but we can modify words which inturn modifies unmodifiableList
