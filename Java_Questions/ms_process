// Double Checked Locking based Java implementation of

class Singleton
{
    private volatile static Singleton obj;

    private Singleton() {}

    public static Singleton getInstance()
    {
        if (obj == null)
        {
            // To make thread safe
            synchronized (Singleton.class)
            {
                // check again as multiple threads
                // can reach above step
                if (obj==null)
                    obj = new Singleton();
            }

2nd Technical
--------------------
1st he asked me to explain the whole flow of data from client page to data base and explained all the details about MVC pattern and other.
2nd about database.
3rd he asked me a design question, I managed to answer that, they will give lot of clues, you have to grab their clues and proceed, by the way think loudly, so that they will understand what you are thinking, which helps them understand your thought process, your way of approach to each and every problem.
4th he asked me about a hobby and he asked me the moral of the book I recently read. we were talking about more than 20 min on this particular question alone.
