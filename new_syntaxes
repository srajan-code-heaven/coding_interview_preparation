Unordered Set
Unordered sets are containers that store unique elements in no particular order, and which allow for fast retrieval of individual elements based on their value.

In an unordered_set, the value of an element is at the same time its key, that identifies it uniquely. Keys are immutable, therefore, the elements in an unordered_set cannot be modified once in the container - they can be inserted and removed, though.
